# Next JS Hackathon

## Vercel Deployment

The website is deployed to Vercel. You can preview it in the link below: *https://gohorse.vercel.app/*

## Hackathon Goals

We divided our goals in steps:

1. Create a Hello World Next JS Application
2. Connect to a public GraphQL API somewhere to list data
3. Create sub-pages with details with the listed data
4. Use a CMS to connect into *we choose Contentful for simplicity.
5. List data from the CMS and create detail pages
6. Connect to a plataform to deploy our site (Netlify, Vercel, etc) *We choose Vercel
7. Make sure the pages are pre-built and delivered as HTML to Vercel *We are not sure we were able to accomplish that!
8. handling data changes in the CMS and automatic deploy to Vercel *Not done, we did not get there
